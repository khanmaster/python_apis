# This task is to be completed by 9:30am on 06/07/2020.
# Needs to be done individually - you can join the call at 9:30am instead of 9am

## Create 4 new Separate projects in pycharm to push to 4 separate Repositories to github, called: 

### student_data_inheritance 
### student_data_encapsulation
### student_data_polymorphism
### student_data_abstraction

# Create two python files and one READEME.md in each Repository
- Student_data.py file as a parent class and DevOps_student.py as a child class
- Each student_data.py Must have at least 2 attributes and 2 methods
- Each student_data.py must have one public and private method and attribute
- Student_data.py must be imported in devops_student.py to implement each oop pillar in their respective Repositories 

``` 
NOTE: ONLY ONE OOP PILLAR'S FUNCTIONALITY NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVED IN EACH REPO AS PER THEIR NAMES

```
```bash

example:

Create a class named Student_Data
with firstname and lastname and __age attributes,

def elevators_pitch method(self):
returns "type your actual elevators pitch here"

def __address(self, house no, street, post_code)
return "full address"

```

# Create a power point presentation to present above exercise and time box it for 5 minutes total.

# Your presentation must include:
## Your elevator's pitch of up to 1 minute (minimum 45-sec)
## code walk through in pycharm and git hub Repositories
## code Demo by running your code successfully in pycharm

# Assessment criteria:
## Best practices that we have learned from business week till date
### You will be assessed on the following points:
- Ability to follow and implement the instruction given
- Presentation Skills - practical implementation of show casing the amazing skills we learned in business week
- Elevator's Pitch
- Sudo coding in pycharm and README.md documentation for git hub
- Best practices of python coding - OOP pillars
- Time boxing 
- DOD - Definition of Done
